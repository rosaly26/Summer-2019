    <h1>What Did I Do Summer 2019 </h1>

        <h2> Girls Who Code </h2>
        <p>
          I joined the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program to learn more about computer science field and to gain coding skills. I had no experience or knowledge in coding and I wanted to increase my knowledge while also finding new interests and passions. I not only learn computer science skills, but also create a sisterhood and enviornment for intellectually curious young adults. I would reccommend this program to any young girl who aspires to have a career in the STEM field and wants to gain early experince as a young woman. <a href="https://girlswhocode.com/"> girlswhocode</a>

      <h2>Beach Bum Beauties</h2>
      <p> My mom and I went to Far Rockaway Beach in Queens for the first time. The beach was very clean and it was very nice. I got a tan and went in the waves. My mom and I also collected shells and rocks on the sand. We got milkshakes aftwerwards. Although I did get sunburn, I had a really good time and would go to the beach again especially with my friends.

      <h2>Road Trips and Sunsets </h2>
        <p>I took a road trip to visit the Boston Univeristy Campus with my mother to learn more about BU's values and student life on campus.
          I really enjoyed the road trip and it was very cool to see how different the enviornment and culture is between NYC and Boston!
